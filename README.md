# Overview
This project involves the development of a Credit Risk Assessment model to evaluate the creditworthiness of small businesses. Using the SBA loan dataset and classification techniques, the model aims to improve the loan portfolio management in banking by accurately identifying potential defaulters.

## Features
Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and identify key features.
Data Cleaning: Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance.
Model Development: Applied various classification techniques to build the risk assessment model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tools & Technologies
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and model development.
Python: Main programming language used.
Numpy: For numerical computations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.

## Machine Learning Techniques: 
Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Dataset
The dataset used is the SBA loan dataset, which includes information about loans given to small businesses, along with their repayment status.

## Results
The final model provides accurate predictions of loan defaults, helping banks to better manage their loan portfolios by identifying high-risk borrowers.
